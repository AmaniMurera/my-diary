This was very wonderfull, I did not have much to do other than enjoy and dance classic music. It was the funniest and amazing moment.</p>
                                                   
         
         <p>Another great thing that really stood out in my summer was that I met new people from other countries of the world including Wisconsin and the UK and Germany. First I ran away to England. This is the most exciting experience I have ever experienced. this summer not like my other summers I had some new experiences and memories that make me feel good and smile. as this  summer is very hot I spend much time in the swimming pool.</p>
            
         <p> In addition,I have got many jobs one of them was working as system administarter in Kigali institute of technology. then I would work as IT supporter in the Kigali commercial bank, the best thing off this were all the new peaple that I meet during my adventure. Next I had another job as networking engineer in Kigali electronic service. those were the jobs that I had over the summer and My experience thought me a tons of things about control myself and managing time.</p>
